# TrainScheduler
The train scheduler web-app was made with:
1. Moment.js
1. Firebase
1. Bootstrap
1. jQuery
1. HTML/CSS

## How-To
The train schedule is structured in a table that holds information about the train name, destination, first arrival time, and the next arrival. Moment.js and jQuery were used to calculate the next arrival time of each train.

The clear button clears the table and the database in firebase.
